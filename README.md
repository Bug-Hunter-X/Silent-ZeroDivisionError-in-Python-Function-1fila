This repository contains a Python function that demonstrates a subtle and uncommon error: a silent ZeroDivisionError.  The function `function_with_uncommon_error` handles the ZeroDivisionError, but instead of raising an exception or returning an error code, it silently returns `None`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues in larger programs. The solution provided shows how to improve error handling to make the error more apparent and easier to address.
